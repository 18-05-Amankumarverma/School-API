PASSWORD="aman@123"
DBNAME="schoolDB"
```
### NOTE:

After cloning the project make sure you have mysql workbench or any sql database.
then run this query in it

```sql

CREATE DATABASE schoolDB;
USE studentDB;
CREATE TABLE schools (
    schoolId INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    schoolName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    address VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    latitude FLOAT,
    longitude FLOAT

```bash
npm start
```

The server should now be running at: `http://localhost:3000`
